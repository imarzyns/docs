== Deploying the {qat-mcg-pattern}

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console] and select *Services \-> Containers \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`.
 ** link:../../multicloud-gitops-qat/mcg-qat-cluster-sizing[Cluster sizing] requirements.
* Openshift Cluster must have Image Registry, https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/registry/configuring_registry_storage/configuring-registry-storage-rhodf.html[Setup Guide]
* CephFS should be set as default Storage Class https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage.html#change-default-storage-class_persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage[Setup Guide]
* BIOS should be configured according to https://github.com/intel/qatlib/blob/7429ee2b7c837137ed11959a3c2cc3729dc15739/INSTALL#L104[official instructions]. Please consult your platform guide on how to do this. Configuration options should be similar to these:
 ** Socket configuration > IIO configuration > Intel VT-d Enabled
 ** Platform Configuration > Miscellaneous Configuration > SR-IOV Support Enabled
 ** Socket Configuration > IIO Configuration > IOAT Configuration > Sck<n> > IOAT Configuration Enabled
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].
+
. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/qat-accelerated-istio[multicloud-gitops-qat] repository on GitHub.
. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone git@github.com:your-username/qat-accelerated-istio.git
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials for the config-demo application and edit it if you want to customize the secret. If not, the framework generates a random password.
+
[source,terminal]
----
cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
====

. (Optional) You may customize the deployment for your cluster depending on your needs by editing values-global.yaml and values-hub.yaml. To do this run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
git checkout -b my-branch
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
vi values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git add values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git commit values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git push origin my-branch
----

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator] - both methods are described below.

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

This is preferred way of installation, as it does not require from user to manually generate and put certificates in Hashicorp Vault.
To deploy the cluster by using the `pattern.sh` file, complete the following steps:

. Login to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc login
----
+
Optional: Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable for the `kubeconfig` file path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
./pattern.sh make install
----

After installation is done user must wait until all required Machine Configurations are applied to worker nodes. Depending on node specifications, rebooting and applying changes can take around 30 minutes. User can check progress by running command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc get mcp
----

If `worker` MachineConfigPool is marked as ready all applications will automatically continue deployment.

Verify that the Operators have been installed.

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1): 
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes* 
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes* 
* *Node Feature Discovery Operator* 
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*
* *Validated Patterns Operator*
* *Sail Operator*
* *Intel Device Plugin Operator*
+

+

== Deploying the cluster by using the Validated Patterns Operator

To install the *Validated Patterns Operator*:

. Log in to the *Openshift Container Platform* web console and select *Operators > OperatorHub*.

. Search for *Validated Patterns Operator*, open it and click *Install*.
+
.Instal Validated Patterns Operator
image::multicloud-gitops-qat/qat-validated-pattern-operator.png[Install Validated Patterns Operator,scale=50]
+
. Choose default settings for the installation mode, namespaces and update strategy and confirm it by clicking *Install*.

. Select *Operators > Installed Operators*.

. Ensure that *Validated Patterns Operator* is listed in the `openshift-operators` project with a status `Succeeded`.

After succeeded installation open *Validated Patterns Operator*, go to *Pattern* tab and click *Create Pattern*.

. Fill the *Name* of the pattern `multicloud-gitops-qat` and *Cluster Group Name* `hub` (from _values-global.yaml_ file).

. Under *Git Config > Target Repo* copy the link to your fork and under *Git Config > Target Revision* write the name of your branch (Figure 3).

. Click *Create* to create the pattern.
+
.Create Pattern Form

+


Verify that the rest of Operators have been installed:

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1): 
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes* 
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes* 
* *Node Feature Discovery Operator* 
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*
* *Sail Operator*
* *Intel Device Plugin Operator*

Generate client and server certificates. User can refer to Istio official guide: https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/secure-ingress/#generate-client-and-server-certificates-and-keys

After generating them add them as secrets to *Vault* manually:

. Go to Vault service route. URL can be found:

.. by running command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc -n vault get route vault -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----
+
.. in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for `vault` project.

. Log into the Vault using root token. Root token can be found by executing command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc -n imperative get secrets vaultkeys -ojsonpath='{.data.vault_data_json}' | base64 -d
----
+

. After login go to `secret` catalog and clik *Create secret* and fill all the fields manually (Figure 2):

.. *Path for this secrets* should be look like this: `global/certs/httpbin.example.com.crt`, `global/certs/example.com.crt`, `global/certs/httpbin.example.com.key`.

.. Under *Secret data* key is `secret` and in next field put its value.

.. Click *Add* and then *Save*.
+
.Create secret

+


== Verification

Go to the Hub ArgoCD and verify that all applications are synchronized. The URL can be found in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for the project `multicloud-gitops-qat-hub` or use command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc -n multicloud-gitops-qat-hub get route hub-gitops-server -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

All applications should be `Healthy` and `Synced`:

.ArgoCD panel with `qat-app`
image::multicloud-gitops-qat/multicloud-gitops-argocd-qat.png[Multicloud GitOps Hub with `qat-app`]

Check the logs of a pod `httpbin` to verify if it uses *{intel-qat}*. In the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Workloads > Pods*. Change project to `httpbin` and open the *Logs* tab in the pod details. Go to container `istio-proxy` and check if there are no errors. 

In case of faulty Intel Device Plugin not working correctly or if QAT is not available the error can look like this:

[source,terminal]
----
No devices found
No device found
Failed to start QAT device.	
----

In case of wrong Security Context Constraints (SCC) the error can look like this:

[source,terminal]
----
Cannot open /dev/vfio
----

Verify that all certificates and keys where correctly generated in path `/HOME_PATH/certs`. There should be 11 files: client.example.com.crt, client.example.com.key, example.com.key, helloworld.example.com.csr, httpbin.example.com.crt, httpbin.example.com.key, client.example.com.csr, example.com.crt, helloworld.example.com.crt, helloworld.example.com.key, httpbin.example.com.csr.

If everything installed correctly user can check if Istio is handling requests correctly by sending a request to httpbin application.

[source,terminal]
----
export INGRESS_HOST=<NODE_IP>
export INGRESS_NS=istio-system
export INGRESS_NAME=istio-ingressgateway
export SECURE_INGRESS_PORT=$(oc -n "${INGRESS_NS}" get service "${INGRESS_NAME}" -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].nodePort}')

curl --resolve "httpbin.example.com:${SECURE_INGRESS_PORT}:$INGRESS_HOST" --cacert certs/httpbin.example.com.crt "https://httpbin.example.com:${SECURE_INGRESS_PORT}/status/418"
----

User should get following response:

[source,terminal]
----
-=[ teapot ]=-

   _...._
 .'  _ _ `.
| ."` ^ `". _,
\_;`"---"`|//
  |       ;/
  \_     _/
	`"""`
----

As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].
