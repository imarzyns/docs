Background::
Organizations are aiming to develop, deploy, and operate applications on an open hybrid cloud in a stable, simple, and secure way. This hybrid strategy includes multi-cloud deployments where workloads might be running on multiple clusters and on multiple clouds, private or public.
This strategy requires an infrastructure-as-code approach: GitOps. GitOps uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver infrastructure-as-code. Submitted code checks the continuous integration (CI) process, while the continuous delivery (CD) process checks and applies requirements for things like security, infrastructure-as-code, or any other boundaries set for the application framework. All changes to code are tracked, making updates easy while also providing version control should a rollback be needed.
Moreover, organizations which are looking to deliver distributed applications at scale can make these applications faster by offloading cryptographic tasks to *Intel QuickAssist Technology*.

[id="about-solution"]
== About the solution

This architecture covers hybrid and multi-cloud management with GitOps as shown in following figure. At a high level this requires a management hub, for DevOps and GitOps, and infrastructure that extends to one or more managed clusters running on private or public clouds. The automated infrastructure-as-code approach can manage the versioning of components and deploy according to the infrastructure-as-code configuration.

Benefits of Hybrid Multicloud management with GitOps:

* Unify management across cloud environments.
* Dynamic infrastructure security.
* Infrastructural continuous delivery best practices.

[id="about-technology"]
== About the technology

The following technologies are used in this solution:

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[Red Hat OpenShift Platform]::
An enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, public cloud, and edge deployments. It delivers a complete application platform for both traditional and cloud-native applications, allowing them to run anywhere. OpenShift has a pre-configured, pre-installed, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. It also enables the use of external secret management systems, for example, HashiCorp Vault in this case, to securely add secrets into the OpenShift platform.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[Red Hat OpenShift GitOps]::
A declarative application continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes based on the ArgoCD project. Application definitions, configurations, and environments are declarative and version controlled in Git. It can automatically push the desired application state into a cluster, quickly find out if the application state is in sync with the desired state, and manage applications in multi-cluster environments.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes]::
Controls clusters and applications from a single console, with built-in security policies. Extends the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

Subsequent schematic diagrams provide details on:

* Bootstrapping the management hub (Figure 4)
* Hybrid multi-cloud GitOps (Figure 5)
* Dynamic security management (Figure 6)

[id="bootstrapping-management-hub"]
== Bootstrapping the management hub

The following figure provides a schematic diagram showing the setup of the management hub using Ansible playbooks.

//figure 4 originally
.Schematic diagram of bootstrapping the management hub
image::multicloud-gitops-qat/spi-multi-cloud-gitops-sd-install.png[Schematic diagram of bootstrapping the management hub]

* Set up the OpenShift Container Platform that hosts the Management Hub. The OpenShift installation program provides flexible ways to install OpenShift. An Ansible playbook starts the installation with necessary configurations.

* Ansible playbooks deploy and configure Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and, later, other supporting components such as external secrets management, on top of the provisioned OpenShift cluster.

* Another Ansible playbook installs HashiCorp Vault, a Red Hat partner product chosen for this solution that can be used to manage secrets for OpenShift clusters.

* An Ansible playbook configures and installs the Openshift GitOps operator on the hub cluster. This deploys the Openshift GitOps instance to enable continuous delivery.

[id="hybrid-multicloud-gitops"]
== Hybrid Multicloud GitOps

The following figure provides a schematic diagram showing remaining activities associated with setting up the management hub and clusters using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management.

//figure 5 originally
.Schematic diagram of hybrid multi-cloud management with GitOps
image::multicloud-gitops-qat/spi-multi-cloud-gitops-sd-security.png[Schematic diagram of hybrid multi-cloud management with GitOps]

* Manifest and configuration are set as code template in the form of a `Kustomization` YAML file. The file describes the desired end state of the managed cluster. When complete, the `Kustomization` YAML file is pushed into the source control management repository with a version assigned to each update.
* OpenShift GitOps monitors the repository and detects changes in the repository.
* OpenShift GitOps creates and updates the manifest by creating Kubernetes objects on top of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management.
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management provisions, updates, or deletes managed clusters and configuration according to the manifest. In the manifest, you can configure what cloud provider the cluster will be on, the name of the cluster, infrastructure node details and worker node. Governance policy can also be applied as well as provision an agent in the cluster as the bridge between the control center and the managed cluster.
* OpenShift GitOps continuously monitors the code repository and the status of the clusters reported back to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. Any configuration drift or in case of any failure, OpenShift GitOps will automatically try to remediate by applying the manifest or by displaying alerts for manual intervention.

[id="dynamic-security-management"]
== Dynamic security management

The following figure provides a schematic diagram showing how secrets are handled in this solution.

//figure 6 originally
.Schematic showing the setup and use of external secrets management
image::multicloud-gitops-qat/spi-multi-cloud-gitops-sd-security.png[Schematic showing the setup and use of external secrets management]

* During setup, the token to securely access HashiCorp Vault is stored in Ansible Vault. It is encrypted to protect sensitive content.

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes acquires the token from Ansible Vault during install and distributes it among the clusters. As a result, you have centralized control over the managed clusters through RHACM.

* To allow the cluster access to the external vault, you must set up the external secret management with Helm in this study. OpenShift Gitops is used to deploy the external secret object to a managed cluster.

* External secret management fetches secrets from HashiCorp Vault by using the token that was generated in step 2 and constantly monitors for updates.

* Secrets are created in each namespace, where applications can use them.

[id="extension-of-mcg"]
== {qat-mcg-pattern}

The basic {mcg-pattern} has been extended to highlight the *{intel-5th-gen-xeon-processors}* capabilities, offering developers a streamlined pathway to accelerate their workloads through the integration of *{intel-qat}*.

The basic pattern has been extended by 4 components: Intel Device Plugin Operator, Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD), Sail Operator, and simple HTTP request and response application. The main purpose of this extension is to enable TLS handshaking and showcase how *{intel-qat}* accelerates cryptographic operations.

Intel Device Plugin Operator's task is to expose QAT resources to the Openshift layer, so it makes it easy to use when creating deployments. After QAT resources are properly exposed Node Feature Discovery Operator is deployed. NFD manages the detection of hardware features and configuration in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. It labels the nodes with hardware-specific information.

Sail Operator deploys Istio Service Mesh. It is basically an extra layer added on top of user applications, and it adds capabilities like traffic management between services and security, without manually adding them to code. The Istio version deployed by Sail Operator allows for additional configuration, that is enabling *{intel-qat}* in cryptographic operations. The last added component is the httpbin application, which is HTTP request and response service used for testing and showcase purposes. The workload idea was based on https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/secure-ingress/#configure-a-tls-ingress-gateway-for-a-single-host[Istio's official instructions on how to setup secure TLS ingress gateway].

The appearance of qat as a private key provider in Istio ingress gateway pod logs confirms that Intel QAT is used:
